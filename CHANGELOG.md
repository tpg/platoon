## v1.1.0 - 2023-01-30

This release fixes a number of small bugs that crept into the v1.0 release, mainly around the placement of the `composer.phar` executable.

- Added test support for PHP 8.2.

## v1.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-12-12

This is just a quick fix for the config validation. Hooks arrays should be nullable.

## v1.0.0-beta.1 - 2022-12-12

First beta release for version 1.

- There are some config changes (the most important being the renaming of `path` as `root`).
- A `@release` tag has been added for use in hook scripts.
- There's also been some refactoring.
- Documentation has been updated with the changes.

## v0.3.4 - 2022-12-02

- Includes a new `extra` target settings which can be used to pass additional information to the target. For now, only `composer-flag` is supported.
- Documentation has been updated.

See the **Extra options** documentation [here](https://tpg.github.io/platoon/reference/config.html#extra-options).

- Added a `releases:set` command
- Added a `releases:rollback` command
- Fixed a bug in the text expander for hooks.

## v0.2.0 - 2022-08-04

This version brings basic tag expansion to the hooks system. You can now use things like `@php` or `@artisan`. The hooks have also been updated a little to ensure that remote hooks run from the project root by default.

The dedicated documentation page is now live at [https://tpg.github.io/platoon]().

## v0.1.2 - 2022-08-02

Removed the 60 second timeout for the `deploy` and `cleanup` commands.

## v0.1.1 - 2022-07-29

Fixed a bug in the Envoy script that was causing problems with the Install hook.

## v0.1.0 - 2022-07-17

There's plenty of changes with this version.

- Added a new "hooks" system. Hooks are run AFTER any of the default stuff. If you need more control than what the hooks provide, then public the Envoy script and modify that.
- There's a few tests now using PestPHP ü§∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- The `platoon:finish` command has been removed as it's no longer needed. There is a "finish" hook if you need anything complex.
- Use the "build" hook to add a build task without needing to publish the Envoy script.

## v0.0.1 - 2022-06-21

First official release!

There's plenty of stuff to come and we'll eventually replicate most of the features that Attach√© provided. For now, you can use Platoon to get your deployments going. And since it's based on Laravel Envoy, it's easy to customise as needed.

- Multiple target server support
- Common deployment command
- Release clean up command
