## v0.3.1 - 2022-11-23

Just a small release is update the version of `spatie/laravel-data`.

## v0.3.0 - 2022-08-11

- Added a `releases:list` command
- Added a `releases:set` command
- Added a `releases:rollback` command
- Fixed a bug in the text expander for hooks.

## v0.2.0 - 2022-08-04

This version brings basic tag expansion to the hooks system. You can now use things like `@php` or `@artisan`. The hooks have also been updated a little to ensure that remote hooks run from the project root by default.

The dedicated documentation page is now live at [https://tpg.github.io/platoon]().

## v0.1.2 - 2022-08-02

Removed the 60 second timeout for the `deploy` and `cleanup` commands.

## v0.1.1 - 2022-07-29

Fixed a bug in the Envoy script that was causing problems with the Install hook.

## v0.1.0 - 2022-07-17

There's plenty of changes with this version.

- Added a new "hooks" system. Hooks are run AFTER any of the default stuff. If you need more control than what the hooks provide, then public the Envoy script and modify that.
- There's a few tests now using PestPHP ü§∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- The `platoon:finish` command has been removed as it's no longer needed. There is a "finish" hook if you need anything complex.
- Use the "build" hook to add a build task without needing to publish the Envoy script.

## v0.0.1 - 2022-06-21

First official release!

There's plenty of stuff to come and we'll eventually replicate most of the features that Attach√© provided. For now, you can use Platoon to get your deployments going. And since it's based on Laravel Envoy, it's easy to customise as needed.

- Multiple target server support
- Common deployment command
- Release clean up command
