## v0.0.1 - 2022-06-21

First official release!

There's plenty of stuff to come and we'll eventually replicate most of the features that Attach√© provided. For now, you can use Platoon to get your deployments going. And since it's based on Laravel Envoy, it's easy to customise as needed.

- Multiple target server support
- Common deployment command
- Release clean up command
